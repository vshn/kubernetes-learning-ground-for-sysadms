= Kubernetes Learning Grround For SysAdms

== Motivation
Learn kubernetes by performing a manual installation (using kubeadm). The target audiance are experienced are Linux SysAdmins with one minimal kubernetes know-how. In order to keep the focus on the container platform installation and configuration, most of the system related configuration tasks will be automated.

== Requirements
- VirtualBox
- Vagrant + vagrant-hostmanager + vagrant-vbguest

== Container Platform Components

The following components will be used:

- CentOS 7 for the VMs OS
- Docker CE 19.03.4
- Kubernetes 1.17.0

== Hostname Information
master.klg.local

== Create the "Control-Plane" VM
```sh
vagrant up
vagrant ssh-config --host master > ssh_config
```

=== Control-Plane Setup

.Login to the master VM
[source,shell]
----
ssh -F ssh_config master
----

.Create the cluster (API server)
[source,shell]
----
kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address 192.168.42.2
